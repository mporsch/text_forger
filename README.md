# text_forger
Forge text output using training data from multiple user-provided input texts.

Inspired by http://kingjamesprogramming.tumblr.com/

The input texts are used to train a Markov chain of text elements. After training, output is generated by traversing the Markov chain along random links.

Build using `g++ -o text_forger text_forger.cpp`
